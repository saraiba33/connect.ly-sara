# Hasbro Connect.ly Wireframe

I used the skills that we learned in the last 2 weeks and created a wireframe site following the project outline. The HTML and CSS assed the WAVE and W3C validators. Working with media queries for responsiveness was difficult. I had trouble getting the <main> to change from a 2 column grid to a 1 column grid. I was finally able to adjust the CSS to allow for responsiveness to work correctly on all element.
